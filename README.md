# COVID-19_vaccination_trends

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious public health crisis to have engulfed the world in the last two years. Forecasting the COVID-19 vaccination trend has become difficult. Numerous health professionals, statisticians, researchers, and programmers have been tracking the virus's spread in various parts of the world using a variety of methods. The proliferation of vaccines developed by talented scientists piqued our interest in learning more about ongoing vaccine programs, and our passion for deriving meaningful insights from data drew us to this particular endeavour. For the last year, we have been hoping for vaccines that would allow us to resume our normal lives. In this project, we will examine the global vaccination drive.

The Dataset used for analisys is from the following hyperlink https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv where the data is constantly updated.


The objective of this project is to forecast vaccination rates using data science or machine learning algorithms in order to determine the impact of vaccination on our daily lives. Along with modelling and projecting COVID-19 immunization rates, you will examine correlations between vaccination and a secondary dataset of your choosing. For example, you can investigate the correlation between vaccination rates and the number of new COVID-19 cases or the number of hospitalizations to ascertain how vaccination effects on them. 

The project's overarching goal is to derive insights from the COVID-19 vaccination dataset in order to inform how our healthcare system, government, and industry can tackle this growing problem through increased immunization.
